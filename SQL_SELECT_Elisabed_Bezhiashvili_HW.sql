--The task involves identifying the top 5 most rented movies and determining the expected age of the audience based on the Motion Picture Association (MPAA) film rating system. To do this, we need to track the number of rentals associated with each movie and calculate the rental count by joining the film, inventory, and rental tables. The MPAA rating system categorizes audiences by age range, such as G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17. We will map the MPAA film rating to its expected audience age using a CASE statement. This information is useful for stock management, marketing, and making better purchasing decisions for future inventory. Understanding the expected age group of the most rented movies can help tailor marketing efforts and ensure content is marketed to the correct demographic. Studios and rental services can also predict demand and manage inventory accordingly. The solution strategy is either a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a direct query.
/* Table Relationships:
   - film: Contains movie information including title and rating
   - inventory: Links films to physical copies available for rent
      â†’ inventory.film_id connects to film.film_id
   - rental: Tracks when movies were rented out
